## Introduction/Motivation

- There are so many differing characteristics that go into making a decision (ie. city, suspects, guns in the city, examiner skill level, -type of gun, etc.)
- We want to do a Bayesian model that combines a multitude of factors in order to predict the decision made when presented with a questioned gun
- This specific type of model is called a Ordinal Probit model as described by Busey et. al
- https://iupbsapps.shinyapps.io/OrderedProbitDemo/


## Setup and Plan
- We will be using casings as opposed to bullets (consistent with Guyll)
- Drew out a lot of factors to evaluate
- Determining which to use as priors (number of suspects, area the gun was shot, etc)
- Determining likelihood ratios using the Busey Model:
- P(E∣Hs​): probability of observing the evidence if the prints are from the same finger
- P(E∣Hd): probability of observing the evidence if they are from different fingers




## Data
- We plan to use data from the Monson et al. (2022) cartridge case study
- Fired cartridge cases were collected from 27 Berettas and 10 non-Berettas (Jimenez)
- Each comparison set contains one questioned item and two reference items
- Study used 5-level AFTE conclusions - form our thresholds
- Throw out unsuitables


## Methodology

- We plan to model using an ordinal probit model similar to Busey et. al. 2023
- Ordinal probit model
$$
p(y=k, \mu , \sigma, \{\theta_j\}) = \Phi((\theta_k - \mu)/ \sigma) - \Phi((\theta_{k-1} - \mu)/ \sigma) 
$$
- If we treat this like a regression, we can make it into more of a hierarchical model

## Methodology cont.

## Bayes'
- We can use priors for different thresholds
- We can establish different priors depending on city etc.
- We will end up with a likelihood ratio that we can plug into our Guyll methodology

## Modeling
- Not going well so far: initial paper uses JAGS, but we want to use Stan
- A regression (rstanarm or brms) context would make this easier
- Understanding how our data works with the Busey methodology
- Thoughts?

## Timeline

- *Week 8:* Initial simulations and EDA of data
- *Week 9:* Build out simulation and model
- *Week 10:* Finish main simulation, start thinking about more complex models/simulations
- *Early next term:* Finish in-depth models and sims, start shiny app
- *Middle next term:* Start building poster and report, finish shiny app
- *Late next term:* Finalize poster and written report
