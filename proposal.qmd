## Introduction 


## Setup and Plan



## Data
- We plan to use data from the Monson et al. (2022) cartridge case study
- Fired cartridge cases were collected from 27 Berettas and 10 non-Berettas (Jimenez)
- Each comparison set contains one questioned item and two reference items
- Study used 5-level AFTE conclusions, we will merge inconclusives together and have 3-level AFTE conclusions
- Throw out unsuitables
